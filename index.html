                    increases with the influx of water into the house. For this, carboxylic acid should be kept aorund
                    the inside of the house.</p>

                <p>Boys and girls find it difficult to go to school or college during the floods. Water rises a lot of
                    the time in school and college. For which class activities are suspended.</p>
